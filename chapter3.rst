"Do you know", Magnum started, "that the human ear essentially performs a Fourier transform".
Gerrit would never miss such a conversation topic. Leaving Jenkins for a while, he turned over towards Magnum.
Magmnun's face showed a mixture of expectation and delight over the clever explanation he is about to give.
Magnum loves giving long, rich with body language, picturesque explanations using a common language that gives
good intuition for the most abstract ideas. Motivated by altruism and in return for appreciation  Magnum would
give a clear and long explanation over much more then he was asked about. Magnum needed constant appreciation from
everyone.

Now, he was holding his favorite industrial cookie already dipped in his tiny espresso cup not minding the oily
cookie crumbs floating in his coffee - crumbs that would accumulate during his explanation. Magnum took a bite,
gestured with his right hand at his ear and opened up the explanation.

"Every sound can be decomposed to fundamental components, much like integer numbers to their prime factors".
Satisfied with his analogy his voice got stronger. "Each such component is characterized by something called
frequency". The word frequency was pronounced a bit slower with the 'r' emphasized. His right hand made a wave
movement going up and down while moving from left to right. "The ear", he continued, "The ear". Whenever reaching
a critical point, he used to repeat words. Sometimes he would repeat whole sentences. "The ear has different
sensory receptors for different frequencies" (emphasized 'r' again). Now, he put the cookie on the table, ignoring
the moisty bits being spread and got up to the whiteboard knowing that hand waving would not be enough.

He drew out the whiteboard eraser from behind the computer screen, whose top was covered by a thin layer of
whiteboard markers dust, and erased the board. Before erasing it, the board was filled with his detailed ideas
in black, blue and red. Ideas over which he passionately argued an hour earlier. Passion that was kept for
times when he felt his professional authority is in doubt.

Now he drew on the board a spiral line along which he placed blue dots in equal distances. "This is the inner ear",
he elucidated. "These dots are sensors, and each such sensor responds to a different frequency", he said while
pointing at the blue dots. "Assume for example that a certain sound is made of the frequencies X, Y and Z",
he moved his left hand along his neck towards his mouth stretching the fingers out making a gesture of producing
a sound, "and, say, that these three dots respond to those frequencies and send signals to the brain". He chose at
random three dots and colored them red as if they vibrated to the sound he produced. Now he gave Gerrit a look filled
with excitement over this nature wonder, expecting the same from him.

Gerrit, being fully aware that this explanation is a direct result of the previous argument, scratched his head
and quickly asked about the relationship of all that to Fourier transform.

Magnum stirred the coffee earnestly with his cookie, ignoring the amount of remains it leaves there, and replied
with disappointment in his voice. Disappointment over the ending of the exotic parts of the explanation. "Well,
Fourier showed that every mathematical function can be represented a sum of periodic functions, and what the auditory
system actually does" - the enthusiasm came back to his voice - "is to perform this decomposition and then somehow put
it back again uniquely identifying a certain voice or sound". "You see", he said, as if some doubt penetrated him during
his speech and now he was back again confident about his knowledge - "different voices have different components or
different FOURIER TRANSRORM, and our ear which is capable of doing this transform can identify different voices help
associating them with different persons."

With a winner's smile Magnum finished his coffee and went out to the floor's kitchen to wash his cup. Gerrit
could not help thinking if nothing gets lost during the re-composition.
