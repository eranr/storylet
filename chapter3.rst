The CORE’s club was a 24 by 7 hookah bar designed in a cheap oriental taste. The
air was thick with sweet smells that would stick to your clothing forever. A
loud instrumental fusion of jazz, oriental and pop music was endlessly played in
the background. From time to time players would perform the exact same thing
live, straining on every bit.

"Where have you been”, Gerrit heard a shout in his direction. Gerrit looked
around and saw Swift taking a long deep and slow inhale before smiling smugly at
him. Gerrit liked Swift. Although he was very self-satisfied, he could not
care less about his karma, and was really enthusiastic about his work. No,
Swift is certainly not a corporate drone, although Gerrit could not tell what
he is.

“Did a Jenkins job”, Gerrit replied.

“So its because of you that its down for the past few days?”

“Yeah”, Gerrit answered gloomily, “I actually thought I did a good job, turned
out to be too good”, too good is bad for the karma Gerrit thought without
saying.

“Give me a pint, and PLEASE do not pour it yourself”, Gerrit barked at the
serving bot.

“Sure sir, the usual?” that 'poor step for beer and questionable step for
technology' machine replied.

Swift grinned; “won’t help ya, they are all the same model and always running
the latest patch, the heavy one is actually proud about it”.

“Yes, the usual” Gerrit replied and got himself seated.

The “heavy one” was Glance, the owner of the greasy joint. He has been there
even before Gerrit and Nova. At some point he got tired and switched to
developing these serving bots.

Some people say he had major disagreements with the former PTL after which
Glance left his position, and the former PLT the plant.

While the hookah bar started off as a mere excuse to test those bots, Glance
shortly fell in love with it. The fact that 'the COREs' became the devs favorite
hangout place must have helped. Having all the newbies around did not
do any good to the place, Gerrit reckoned.

“What’s up guys”, Glance was approaching them. On his belt there was a huge ring with several identical stone keys.
“What’s with the keys, Glance?” Swift asked.
“I carve a new one each time I give life to a new bot” Glance answered with a large smile (exposing his hookah smoking teeth).
“I already have 8 of them”
They could not miss the pride that was all over Glance as he said that.

"So, what happened with that Jenkins job of yours". So everybody know by now, Gerrit thought.

"What did you think", Glance added looking on Gerrit's face, "If Jenkins is out of order then
no karma for no one".

"Better for no one then for some", Gerrit answered grimming. Swift laughed loudly at that.
