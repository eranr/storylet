Gerrit woke up in his flat that was located in the west side of the plant
looking at the port. Nova was not there when he woke up. She must be working on
her karma he thought as he got up and looked down at the harbor. There was an
unusual traffic of dockworkers unloading containers. Strangely, he could neither
see nor here any seagulls, only those silent containers everywhere.

“Hi” he heard Nova’s soft voice behind him, “There seem to be coming more and
more of them lately”, she added. Gerrit imagined hearing a sad tone in her
voice. “You should be happy”, he said thinking of the growing karma the
dockworkers must have. “I know” Nova answered with that same tone. “I am making
some coffee do you want some?” Nova asked. Gerrit nodded and watched her as she
left for the kitchen. He could clearly see the stripe of her bra below her
pointy shoulder blades under her long dress. While they have been together for
six years now, Gerrit was still surprised from time to time that he is not
single anymore.

“I think I will go to the CORE’s club”, he called after her, “you know, to
catch up”. Gerrit expected the usual answer of “nothing creative, original or
revolutionary came from there for a long time now”. Instead, he heard Nova
replying: “I can tell you what’s been going on”.
