The CORE’s club was a 24 by 7 hookah bar designed in a cheap oriental taste. The
air was thick with sweet smells that would stick to your clothing forever. A
loud instrumental fusion of jazz, oriental and pop music was endlessly played in
the background. From time to time players would perform the exact same thing
live, straining on every bit.

"Where have you been”, Gerrit heard a shout in his direction. Gerrit looked
around and saw Swift taking a long deep and slow inhale before smiling smugly at
him. Gerrit liked Swift. Although he was very self-satisfied, he could not to
care less about his karma, and was really enthusiastic about his work.  

“Did a Jenkins job”, Gerrit replied.

“So its because of you that its down for the past few days?”

“Yeah”, Gerrit answered gloomily, “I actually thought I did a good job, turned
out to be too good”, too good is bad for the karma Gerrit thought without
saying.

“Give me a pint, and PLEASE do not pour it yourself”, Gerrit barked at the
serving bot.

“Sure sir, the usual?” the 'poor step for beer and questionable step for
technology' machine replied.

Swift grinned; “won’t help ya, they are all the same model and always running
the latest patch, the heavy one is actually proud about it”.

“Yes, the usual” Gerrit replied and got seated.
