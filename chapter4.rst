Gerrit and Nova have been there pretty much from the beginning. Before the
plant, the talent locators and the karma. It all rapidly grew around them almost
without noticing, until they felt suffocated. Still, they could not leave.

The CORE’s club was a 24 by 7 hookah bar designed in a cheap oriental taste. The
air was thick with sweet smells that would stick to your clothing forever. A
loud instrumental fusion of jazz, oriental and pop music was endlessly played in
the background. From time to time players would perform the exact same thing
live, straining on every bit.

“Where have you been”, Gerrit heard a shout in his direction. Gerrit looked
around and saw Swift taking a long deep and slow inhale before smiling at him.
"Had a Jenkins job", Gerrit replied.
