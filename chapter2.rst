Gerrit hated his assignment; he particularly hated the need to kill those
evolution flight marvels not to mention the depressing company of Jenkins.

While he hated his current project, he was very proud of Jenkins dream patch
where he made a huge change with such a small diff. Gerrit knew this would make
his karma shine, so brightly shine he thought that even the plant’s talent
locator would take notice. With this cheerful thought Gerrit impetuously shot
out his tongue to catch an innocent fly and fell asleep.

In his dream Gerrit was in his casual dev form walking through the long bright
corridor leading to the PTL’s office, to which he was summoned. The corridor had
huge windows through which he could see the panoramic plant’s skyline in the 
orange light of the setting sun. Gerrit walked slowly cherishing the moment.
When he finally entered the room he was aghast to see Jenkins sitting in the
PTL’s chair smiling at him.

Gerrit was busy thinking how inconceivable it is for Jenkins to smile, when he
started to talk: "Thanks to you Gerrit I am now the plant's talent locator, and
I want YOU for the next plat's big thing". Jenkins started preaching about the
next big thing and Gerrit's karma, while pointing his blaming finger at him.
Pointing the same way he used to point at his buggy code when he found it.
By now, the smile left Jenkin's face, and Gerrit woke up with the word YOU
resonating in his head.
