Gerrit hated his assignment; he particularly hated the need to kill those
evolution flight marvels not to mention the depressing company of Jenkins.

While he hated his current project, he was very proud of Jenkins dream patch
where he made a huge change with such a small diff. Gerrit knew this would make
his karma shine, so brightly shine he thought that even the plant’s talent
locator would take notice. With this cheerful thought Gerrit impetuously shot
out his tongue to catch an innocent fly and fell asleep.

In his dream Gerrit was in his casual dev form walking through the long bright
corridor leading to the PTL’s office, to which he was summoned. The corridor had
huge windows through which he could see the panoramic plant’s skyline in the 
orange light of the setting sun. Gerrit walked slowly cherishing the moment.
When he finally entered the room he was aghast to see Jenkins sitting in the
PTL’s chair smiling at him.
