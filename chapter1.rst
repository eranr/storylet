Gerrit woke up in his flat that was located in the west side of the plant
overlooking the port. Nova was not there when he woke up. She must be working on
her karma he thought as he got up and looked down at the harbor. There was an
unusual traffic of dockworkers unloading containers. Strangely, he could neither
see nor here any seagulls, only those silent containers everywhere.

“Hi” he heard Nova’s soft voice behind him, “More and more of those seem to come in 
lately”, she added. Gerrit imagined hearing a sad tone in her voice.
“You should be happy”, he said thinking of the growing karma of the
dockworkers. “I know” Nova answered. That same sad tone again. “I am making
some coffee do you want some?” Nova asked. Gerrit nodded and watched her as she
left for the kitchen. Looking after her he noted the stripe of her bra below her
pointy shoulder blades under her long summer dress. It struck him again that he is
with a woman. For many years Gerrit was pondering on the nature of the female partner
he did not have.

It has been six years now that they are together, and they have been there
together pretty much from the beginning: Before the plant, the talent locators
and the karma. Almost without noticing it all grew very rapidly around them
until they felt suffocated. Still, they could not leave.

“I think I will go to the CORE’s club”, he called after her, “I want to
catch up and could use a well poured pint after all those flies”. Gerrit
knew Nova hated the place, with the major reason being “nothing creative,
original or revolutionary came from there for a long time now”. Gerrit also
expected her answer: "You know there is nothing new, just more newbies looking
for karma."

Gerrit drank his coffee, gave Nova a light kiss and left for the club.
